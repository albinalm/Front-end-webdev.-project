### Notes
Had some issues implementing API and retrieving data, and also didn't really find a suitable API that would fulfill my needs.
The solution became a weather API to retrieve weather data according to your location in which are gathered by another Geolocation API based on your IP-adress.
Regarding the data retrieval, I wasn't sure how to begin or understanding the syntax. But after some research together with trial, error and some experiments during live view, I  managed to get it working.

I still haven't figured out how to retrieve first name from Okta, so email will do for now.
#### Update from a later point; I managed to get first name working! And I have barely any idea why!

* **~~Finish designing account page~~** - **Basic features are there. Verifying with @gustavnyberg if the current data retrieval is accepted for this assignment.**
* **~~Research REST-API to use~~** - **Implemented Weather API together with Geolocation to retrieve local weather data based on current location.**

## Today
* Discuss with Gustav if your project is on track.
